    <h1>About Us</h1>
    Founded in 1983, Taco Casa was born out of a passion for authentic Mexican cuisine and a
    desire to share it with the world.<br>Drawing inspiration from family recipes passed down through
    generations, our founders set out to create a dining destination<br>where every bite tells a story
    of tradition, family, culture. <br>
    <br>
    Our extensive menu is filled with authentic, hand crafted meals that will transport you to the 
    heart of mexico. Every bite will bring a<br>symphony of delicious flavor and tradition.<br>
